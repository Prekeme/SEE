# 📝 README - Fun Calculator 🎉

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This lightweight Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers. With playful comments and emoji flair, it makes simple math operations more enjoyable! 😊

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Addition** - Adds two numbers
- ➖ **Subtraction** - Subtracts the second number from the first
- ✖ **Multiplication** - Multiplies two numbers
- ➗ **Division** - Divides the first number by the second (handles decimals)
- 😎 **User-Friendly** - Interactive input with clear output formatting
- 🎉 **Fun Vibe** - Entertaining comments and emojis make coding joyful!

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The script prompts the user to enter two numbers (supports decimals).
2. It performs four basic arithmetic operations.
3. Results are displayed in a clean, formatted output.

## 🛠️ Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

### Running the Script
1. Copy the code into a file named `fun_calculator.py`
2. Run it using:
   ```bash
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter numbers and see the results!

### Example Session
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2.5

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5 ➕
Difference: 7.5 ➖
Product: 25.0 ✖
Quotient: 4.0 ➗
```

## ⚠️ Note
- The script doesn't currently handle division by zero gracefully (it will crash if you divide by zero). Future improvements could add error handling for this case!
